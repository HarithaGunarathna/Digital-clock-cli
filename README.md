# Digital-clock-cli

## Description
Developed a program that displays the current time and the date on a linux terminal. When a colour is given to the program as an argument, it should be able to display the clock with that colour.

## Outcome
I have gained proficiency in working within a Linux environment, demonstrating competence in utilizing ANSI characters to construct basic figures and characters, efficiently handling command line arguments, and effectively employing debugging techniques.
